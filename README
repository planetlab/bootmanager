Starting with 5.0

===
the entry point for the boot CD is installed in the location below
this is expected to return the signed shell script that runs the bootmanager
    /var/www/html/boot/index.php
the bootmanager rpm installs most of its stuff in
    /usr/share/bootmanager/regular/
and the default signed script is created as
    /var/www/html/boot/bootmanager_regular.sh.sgn

===
If you need to create an alternate version for a specific 'deployment'
tag, say fror 'alpha' nodes, you need to

* create /usr/share/bootmanager/alpha/
* populate its build.sh and source subdirs, just as in 'regular'
* and run service plc start bootmanager

---
Alternatively from a source tree, if you have root ssh access to the plc box, you can do
$ cd svntree/BootManager/trunk
$ make sync
.. see the usage text
$ make sync DEPOLOYMENT=alpha PLC=boot.onelab.eu

which should do everything needed

===
It's also possible to attach a (signed) bm script to a unique node by renaming a .sgn into
/var/www/html/boot/bootmanager_<hostname>.sh.sgn

======================================== bootstrapfs
the actual name of the bootstrapfs('s) that need to be installed is
computed in the PLCAPI, namely the GetNodeFlavour method 

In essence:

* if the node has the 'deployment' tag set, then we fetch
https://.../boot/bootstrafs-<deployment>.tar.bz2
* otherwise we get
https://.../boot/bootstrafs-<nodefamily>.tar.bz2

* as far as extensions, we fetch
https://.../boot/bootstrafs-<extension>-<arch>.tar.bz2
  for all defined extensions

* also if the plainbootstrapfs tag is set, then the uncompressed files
  are fetched
